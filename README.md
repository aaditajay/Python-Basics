# Python Basics 🐍

This repository contains **very basic Python programs and mini projects** that I worked on during my **11th and 12th grade** while learning the fundamentals of Python.

The projects here focus on understanding core concepts such as:
- Variables and data types  
- Conditional statements  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- Basic problem-solving logic  

### Purpose
This repository is meant to:
- Track my early learning journey in Python  
- Store beginner-level practice programs  
- Show my starting point before moving into advanced projects  

### Note
These projects are **beginner-level** and may not follow advanced coding standards.  
They are kept here for **learning reference and growth tracking**.
